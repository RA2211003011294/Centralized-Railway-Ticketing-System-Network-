Centralized Railway Ticketing System Network 



The proposed network architecture incorporates hierarchical design principles, including Core, 
Distribution, and Access layers. Each layer is equipped with redundancy mechanisms to minimize 
downtime and ensure failover in case of hardware or network failures. VLANs (Virtual Local Area 
Networks) are deployed to segment the network based on functional areas, such as ticketing 
counters, administrative offices, and server rooms, improving both performance and security. Inter
VLAN routing is configured to enable controlled communication between these segments. 

Advanced IP addressing schemes, including subnetting and DHCP, are implemented to optimize IP 
resource allocation. Static and dynamic routing protocols, such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), 
are employed to ensure efficient and reliable data routing across the network. Security measures, 
including Access Control Lists (ACLs) and port security, are integrated to protect sensitive ticketing 
data from unauthorized access and potential cyber threats. 

The network design is validated through rigorous testing, including connectivity checks, redundancy 
simulations, and performance evaluations. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed architecture in providing a secure, efficient, and scalable solution for centralized railway 
ticketing. This project not only addresses the technical challenges of network design but also 
highlights the critical role of networking in supporting large-scale operational systems, ultimately 
contributing to the seamless functioning of the railway industry.
